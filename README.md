# FDA Liver Abscess Trial

This code is for the analysis of the data for the manuscript titled: The efficacy of different durations of tylosin phosphate supplementation for the control of liver abscesses in feedlot cattle: a Bayesian network meta-analysis supported by a randomized controlled trial.
This code has been separated into multiple components. One code set is for the analysis of liver outcome data from the primary trial, one is for the analysis of feedlot performance and carcass variables from the controlled trial, and one is for the analysis of non-inferiority of treatments from the network meta-analysis.
